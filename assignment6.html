<h1>Reptiles as pets</h1>
<p>
    Since I was young, I've found reptiles to be great pets! 
    I think geckos are very cool. I've had two pet geckos in my lifetime, 
    the second one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_gecko">Crested Gecko</a>
    named Gucci that I had for over <strong>ten</strong> years! 
    <br>Someday I hope to have a pet Chameleon, though its important to do 
    <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/chameleons-t2-1236756">proper caretaking research</a>.

<p>Here is a picture of a cool crested gecko!</p>
